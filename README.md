Project Description: Billing System with MySQL Integration

This project is a Billing System application developed using programming concepts that generates a customer bill based on input details such as items, quantity, and price. The program automatically calculates the total amount and generates a formatted bill.

The generated bill is stored in a separate text file for record-keeping and future reference. In addition to file handling, the system is connected to a MySQL database, where billing details such as customer information, bill number, date, and total amount are stored securely.

This project demonstrates the use of:

Conditional statements and loops

File handling to write data into a text file

Database connectivity using MySQL

Basic CRUD operations (Insert and Retrieve data)

The system helps in maintaining billing records efficiently and reduces manual work, making it suitable for small shops or learning database-connected applications.
